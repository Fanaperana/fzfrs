//! # fuzzly - Fuzzy Search Algorithm Implementation
//!
//! A comprehensive, educational implementation of fuzzy search algorithms.
//! This library provides tools for approximate string matching using the
//! Levenshtein distance algorithm.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## What is fuzzy search?
//!
//! A normal search requires an **exact** match: searching for `"aple"` in a list
//! won't find `"apple"`.  Fuzzy search relaxes that requirement — it finds strings
//! that are *close enough*, even when they contain typos or small differences.
//!
//! The key idea is to measure how many **edits** (insert / delete / substitute a
//! single character) it takes to turn one string into another.  Fewer edits means
//! a better match.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Learning path — where to start
//!
//! If you are new to this topic, read the types in this order:
//!
//! 1. **[`LevenshteinDistance::compute`]** — the classic full-matrix
//!    Wagner-Fischer algorithm.  Every cell, every loop, every step is annotated.
//!    Start here to understand the core idea.
//!
//! 2. **[`LevenshteinDistance::compute_optimized`]** — keeps only two rows of the
//!    matrix at once.  A natural next step once you have grasped the full version.
//!
//! 3. **[`LevenshteinDistance::similarity`]** — converts the raw distance into a
//!    0.0–1.0 score humans can reason about.
//!
//! 4. **[`LevenshteinWithOperations`]** — builds the full list of edits by
//!    *backtracking* through the completed matrix.  Great for visualising what the
//!    algorithm actually does.
//!
//! 5. **[`FuzzySearcher`]** — the high-level search interface that brings
//!    everything together and adds practical features like case-insensitivity and
//!    result ranking.
//!
//! 6. **[`LevenshteinDistance::compute_fast`]** — the performance-tuned variant
//!    with an ASCII byte path and smaller DP cells.  Read this last, once you
//!    understand what it is optimising.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! use fuzzly::{FuzzySearcher, LevenshteinDistance};
//!
//! // Calculate edit distance between two strings
//! let distance = LevenshteinDistance::compute("kitten", "sitting");
//! assert_eq!(distance, 3);
//!
//! // Get similarity score (0.0 to 1.0)
//! let similarity = LevenshteinDistance::similarity("apple", "aple");
//! assert!(similarity >= 0.8);
//!
//! // Search through candidates
//! let searcher = FuzzySearcher::new(0.6);
//! let candidates = vec!["apple", "application", "banana"];
//! let results = searcher.search("aple", &candidates);
//! ```
//!
//! ---
//!
//! ## Algorithm Overview
//!
//! The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of
//! single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required
//! to change one string into the other.
//!
//! This implementation uses the Wagner-Fischer dynamic programming algorithm
//! with an optional memory-optimized variant that uses only O(min(m,n)) space.

// LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE - Core Algorithm Implementation
//
// If you are reading this for the first time, focus on `compute` first.
// It uses a full 2-D matrix so that every value is visible and easy to trace.
// The later methods (`compute_optimized`, `compute_fast`) produce identical
// results using less memory or fewer CPU cycles, but are harder to follow
// before you understand the basics.
// ============================================================================

/// Core implementation of the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
///
/// The Levenshtein distance (also known as **edit distance**) is the minimum
/// number of single-character edits needed to turn one string into another.
/// Think of it as the "cost" of fixing a typo.
///
/// ## The three operations
///
/// | Operation    | Description           | Example                    |
/// |--------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
/// | Insert       | Add a character       | `cat` → `cart` (insert r)  |
/// | Delete       | Remove a character    | `cart` → `cat` (delete r)  |
/// | Substitute   | Replace a character   | `cat` → `bat` (sub c → b)  |
///
/// ## Methods at a glance
///
/// | Method | Best for |
/// |--------|----------|
/// | [`compute`](Self::compute) | Learning — shows the full matrix |
/// | [`compute_optimized`](Self::compute_optimized) | Long strings — saves memory |
/// | [`compute_fast`](Self::compute_fast) | Production — fastest path |
/// | [`similarity`](Self::similarity) | Human-readable 0.0–1.0 score |
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use fuzzly::LevenshteinDistance;
///
/// let distance = LevenshteinDistance::compute("kitten", "sitting");
/// assert_eq!(distance, 3); // k→s, e→i, insert g
///
/// let similarity = LevenshteinDistance::similarity("apple", "apple");
/// assert_eq!(similarity, 1.0); // Identical strings
/// ```

    // ── fast_bytes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    // Two-row DP over raw byte slices — the ASCII-only fast path.
    //
    // Optimisation 1 – no Vec<char> allocation:
    //   ASCII characters are all in the range 0x00–0x7F and each fits in exactly
    //   one byte.  `str::as_bytes()` gives us a &[u8] with no heap allocation.
    //
    // Optimisation 2 – adaptive DP cell width (u8 / u16 / u32):
    //   The Levenshtein recurrence with gap cost G = 1 guarantees that every
    //   cell in the DP matrix satisfies
    //       matrix[i][j] ≤ max(i, j) ≤ max(m, n)
    //   because the trivial "delete all, insert all" alignment already achieves
    //   that bound and the algorithm only ever picks something ≤ that.
    //
    //   So the maximum value we'll ever store fits in:
    //     - u8   when max(m, n) ≤ 255
    //     - u16  when max(m, n) ≤ 65_535
    //     - u32  for anything larger (a 4-billion-char string is absurd in practice)
    //
    //   Smaller cells means the two rolling rows take less memory and a much
    //   larger fraction fits into L1/L2 cache, which is the dominant cost in
    //   this memory-bound inner loop.  Going from u32 → u8 is a 4× shrink of
    //   the working set for short strings (the overwhelming common case for
    //   fuzzy matching — search queries, identifier names, filenames…).

// ── Myers' 1999 bit-parallel Levenshtein (single-word variant) ───────────────
//
// Instead of storing each DP cell as an integer, Myers encodes the *differences*
// between consecutive cells in a DP column as two bit-vectors:
//
//   Pv bit i = 1  iff  col[i+1] - col[i] == +1   ("vertical positive delta")
//   Mv bit i = 1  iff  col[i+1] - col[i] == -1   ("vertical negative delta")
//
// The running score is the value of the bottom cell of the current column,
// maintained as a plain integer.  Advancing one column (consuming one text
// character) is done with a fixed sequence of ~7 bitwise operations over
// 64-bit words — no loops over the column.  This is where the O(n) comes from
// when the pattern fits in one machine word.
//
// The update formulas below are the classic ones from Myers' paper; see
// "A fast bit-vector algorithm for approximate string matching based on
// dynamic programming", J. ACM 46(3), 1999, Figure 8.

//   - `p` and `t` are byte slices (treat each byte as an alphabet symbol)

    //   matrix[i-1][j-1] + c   → we substituted (or matched)   (came from diagonal)
    //
    // To recover the path we start at the bottom-right corner (i=m, j=n)
    // and ask "which neighbour produced this cell's value?"  That tells us
    // which operation was chosen.  We move to that neighbour and repeat,
